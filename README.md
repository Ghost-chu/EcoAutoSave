# EcoAutoSave

## Description

Can't imagine Auxilor's Eco series plugin won't auto-save the player's data.  
My server crashed and players data just got lost, that's unacceptable.

## Usage

Just drop-in and working in background.

```text
/ecoautosave reload - Reload configuration.
/ecoautosave save - Force save players data
```
